							    The proliferation of connected edge devices (e.g., smartphones, medical
								wearables, IoT devices, vehicles, etc.) contributes an abundance of huge
								amounts of data, which become a valuable resource for improving the performance
								of Machine Learning (ML) models. To take full advantage of the on-device data,
								traditional ML requires gathering all separate datasets to a centralized 
								location for training model. However, centralizing data brings prohibitive
								communication costs, network resource usage, heavy traffic, and privacy 
								concerns. To address the aforementioned challenges, Federated Learning (FL),
								which is an emerging approach, is used to train a joint model across 
								distributed edge devices while maintaining privacy. Despite its immense
								potential, FL still requires plenty of significant resources, such as time,
								computation power, energy, bandwidth availability, etc. More importantly,
								the computing capabilities available on training devices may vary over time.
								Furthermore, the devices involved in FL training may have varying training
								data sets that differ in size and distribution. This can result in unstable
								and slow convergence of the FL models. These differences can have an impact
								on the FL process and ultimately lead to suboptimal model performance in 
								a heterogeneous federated network.
							   <br><br>
							    In this thesis, we have addressed several of the challenges mentioned above. 
								Initially, an FL algorithm that utilizes cluster analysis to address 
								communication overhead is proposed, which is a major bottleneck for FL, 
								particularly for complex models, large-scale applications, and frequent 
								updates. The subsequent step involved an extension of the aforementioned study
								to encompass wireless networks (WNs), where an energy-efficient transmission
								poses a significant challenge due to the limited resources of WSNs. This has
								motivated us to continue with a comprehensive overview and classification of
								the advanced developments in context-aware edge-based AI models, focusing on
								sensor networks. The review also investigated the related challenges and 
								motivations for adopting AI techniques, along with an analysis of existing
								research gaps. To optimize the aggregation of the FL model and alleviate
								communication costs, the first study is extended with an FL-based cluster
								optimization approach. Furthermore, to reduce the detrimental effect of the
								diverse distribution of data between edge devices, i.e., data heterogeneity
								on FL, a new study of group-personalized FL models is presented. Finally,
								inspired by the aforementioned FL models,  evaluation methods for a 
								client's contribution by measuring its behavior during training are 
								proposed, without requiring excessive computational resources.
							   <br><br>
							    The FL algorithms proposed in this thesis are evaluated on various real-world 
								datasets. This comprehensive evaluation allows us to analyze both the training
								model and FL performance. The results of extensive experiments showed the
								effectiveness and robustness of the proposed FL techniques in for improved
								communication efficiency, resource efficiency, accelerating model convergence,
								efficient aggregation, and reduced data heterogeneity compared with different
								state-of-the-art approaches.
