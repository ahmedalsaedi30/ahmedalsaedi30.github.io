                               <p>
							    Today’s advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables training Machine
								Learning (ML) models on the daily-produced data by connected edge devices.
								To make the most of the data stored on the device, conventional ML approaches
								require gathering all individual data sets and transferring them to a central
								location to train a common model. However, centralizing data incurs significant
								costs related to communication, network resource utilization, high volume
								of traffic, and privacy issues. To address the aforementioned challenges,
								Federated Learning (FL) is employed as a novel approach to train a shared model
								on decentralized edge devices while preserving privacy. Despite the significant
								potential of FL, it still requires considerable resources such as time, 
								computational power, energy, and bandwidth availability. More importantly,
								the computational capabilities of the training devices may vary over time.
								Furthermore, the devices involved in the training process of FL may have 
								distinct training datasets that differ in terms of their size and distribution. As a result of this, the convergence of the FL models may become unstable and slow. These differences can influence the FL process and ultimately lead to suboptimal model performance within a heterogeneous federated network.
							   <br><br>
							    In this thesis, we have tackled several of the aforementioned challenges.
								Initially, a FL algorithm is proposed that utilizes cluster analysis to address
								the problem of communication overhead. This issue poses a major bottleneck in
								FL, particularly for complex models, large-scale applications, and frequent 
								updates. The next research conducted in this thesis involved extending the 
								previous study to include wireless networks (WNs). In WSNs, achieving 
								energy-efficient transmission is a significant challenge due to their limited
								resources. This has motivated us to continue with a comprehensive overview and
								classification of the latest advancements in context-aware edge-based AI 
								models, with a specific emphasis on sensor networks. The review has also 
								investigated the associated challenges and motivations for adopting AI 
								techniques, along with an evaluation of current areas of research that need
								further investigation. To optimize the aggregation of the FL model and 
								alleviate communication expenses, the initial study addressing communication
								overhead is extended to include a FL-based cluster optimization approach. 
								Furthermore, to reduce the detrimental effect caused by data heterogeneity
								among edge devices on FL, a new study of group-personalized FL models has
								been conducted. Finally, taking inspiration from the previously mentioned
								FL models, techniques for assessing clients' contribution by monitoring and
								evaluating their behavior during training are proposed. In comparison with
								the most existing contribution evaluation solutions, the proposed techniques
								do not require significant computational resources.
							   <br><br>
							    The FL algorithms presented in this thesis are assessed on a range of 
								real-world datasets. The extensive experiments demonstrated that the 
								proposed FL techniques are effective and robust. These techniques improve
								communication efficiency, resource utilization, model convergence speed, 
								and aggregation efficiency, and also reduce data heterogeneity when compared
								to other state-of-the-art methods.
